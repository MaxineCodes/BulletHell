# BulletHell Game
Inspired by the Touhou [東方] games series.
 
### A simple SFML game where you dodge bullets.

This is an experiment on writing a simple 2D game, just to see what it takes.     
Most sprites were made by myself in Aseprite, the character sprites are based on the pixelated Touhou characters found in the Nintendo Switch version of the arcade game Groove Coaster.    

This bullet hell game will include scripted events, levels with variable difficulty, and a simple UI.
